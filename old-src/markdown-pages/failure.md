## Failure is failing to understand!

Failure is a word I guess literally every person might fear in this world! Be it a man or woman, surprisingly even animals have a sense of it. Guess why does a mother kills/leaves her own child, and yes I am not talking about a human, no human would do that! It is an understanding in them that they would fail to nourish that child.

_I am no one to change your opinion about failure or anything every human is a master of his own thinking and words. We can't question it, it is impossible!_

And neither I am here to change your thinking about it. I want to express my feeling about failure!

Possibly what would failure mean to a 20-year-old? For it has been a journey of constant failures in life and literally everything that I tried! You might wonder that I could be over exaggerating all this but it is true! Not in the sense that I have never seen even a little success I have did for sure. This blog itself might be considered a success for me. When I finally learnt some programming languages were a success for me and much more!

> **Success is how you measure it!**

It is true success is how we see it, how we compare it, and how we measure it.
But do we have the capability to even do such a simple task? I have faced many hurdles just to try and and get it into my mind and my thinking. But why is it hard? There are several reasons to it and I am not saying that those things are bad or just that I don't have them so I don't like them. But I do blame it on them and there is a reason to it!

Social media is a huge influencer, we call it an influencer network because there are people who do stuff there! It is a great place for companies to promote their products and all, but what about the darker side of it? Social media has forever been in question and the biggest market in today's world. It surely connects people but we underestimate its capabilities, we judge it based on the fact that it makes us meet new people all over the world and things.
If that is true, which indeed I agree it has enabled us to things that our ancestors failed to do. But then why has been mental problems like depression, anxiety, social lonliness been on rise? What is the answer to that question?

Well I bought up the topic of ancestors and wanna talk about a bit more. People say that we've came a long way and have changed a lot and it surely is true. We learnt how to kill each others, how to differentiate each other based on nationality, color, race, caste, religion, and much more. Even the games that we make today generally put humans against humans which also affects the mind of children Americans vs Russians! Americans vs Germans! And finally Americans come out victorias and we all celebrate that we killed 200,000 total enemies in that game which were Germans and we reign supreme!

Our ancestors had one thing that I desire the most today, true relationships! Not only in romantic sense but culturally, socially, and humanistically! Just imagine them talking with each other sharing and caring for each other, knowing that they are not alone and there is someone who cares and thinks about them at least once a day!

And what is all this? **Failure** to understand humanity!

We think that being human is just doing what you do and earning money and whatever else the society teaches us!
I have been facing the same pressure since I graduated high school and things were never the same. Since I never was a social guy I was not able to make friends and things went more horrible as the era of social media came and everything just exploded! It surely is hard much hard to get by and think that things will change. Change is to be bought by us not people, people change, the world changes, and we, we can be where we are in our own cocoon and retreat!

I never truly understood when people told me that I failed, well to be honest we've all failed. We've failed humanity, everytime we refuse to help people and even animals, we've failed ourselves everytime we refuse to take that next step or risk to work on ourselves. Failure truly is universal and there is none in this world who haven't seen it. When we think that we've succeeded that's merely to say that _we've failed enough to pave our way to success!_

So when next time somebody askes me, "Do you think you're successful?" my question to myself would be, _"What does failure mean to me?"_
