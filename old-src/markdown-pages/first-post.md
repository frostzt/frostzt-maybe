## tbh I haven't decided what to do specifically but let's get on with it

It has been quite a long time and I forever wanted a blog where I can speak my mind out. Now this isn't like a `code blog` where I will post tutorials but more specifically the one that I wanted to write since a long time! The one which will speak out my mind, my thoughts, and my ideas!
Things that are buried and what people don't wanna hear, it won't be wistleblowing of course, and yes I don't wanna do it either! I am surely interested in politics but I don't wanna talk about it.

By the way this blog is made using GatsbyJS. The simpleness and ability to make some really great static sites using it is something really facinates me in it.

One more thing: _I really don't want to hurt anyone's feelings or don't target anyone's personal beliefs in my blogs or any of the posts. If you feel offended you're free to close it right at that very moment._

btw yes this website is hosted on Netlify and whatever I've written here is also open-source on GitHub!
